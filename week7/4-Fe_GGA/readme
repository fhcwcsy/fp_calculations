1.this directory only have results using LDA pseudopotential
2.please plot eV curve for BCC;FM & FCC;FM & BCC;NM & FCC;NM, then comment on the ground state for different lattice constant


3.use GGA pesudopotential and redo everything on your own(POTCAR is in the directory above)

4.is LDA or GGA more suitable to describe the ground state of iron?
